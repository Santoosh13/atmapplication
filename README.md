Got it 👍 Since your **ATM application** uses OOP, custom exceptions, and file handling, here’s a clean and professional **README.md** draft for your GitHub repo:

---

# 🏦 ATM Application (Java)

## 📌 Overview

This is a **Java-based ATM application** built to demonstrate core Java concepts such as **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **custom exception handling**, and **file handling for persistent storage**.
It simulates real-world ATM operations including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and transaction history.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔑 **User Authentication** – Secure login using account number and PIN.
* 💰 **Banking Operations** – Deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
* 📜 **Transaction History** – View past transactions for each account.
* 🛠 **Custom Exceptions** – Handles invalid inputs, insufficient funds, and account not found errors gracefully.
* 💾 **File Handling** – Stores account data and transactions persistently using `.ser` files.
* 🧩 **OOP Principles** – Implemented using **classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism** for modular design.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Java (Core)**
* **File I/O (Serialization)**
* **Custom Exceptions**
* **Collections Framework**
